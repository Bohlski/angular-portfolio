# To-do

* Make descriptions etc. of projects
* I believe a pipe is necessary to handle new lines in description (CSS won't handle content projected into component)
* Maybe make pipe that allows description to contain hyperlinks - e.g. "as seen [here](https://test.com)"
* Insert images to use in the projects
* Make everything (projects service) use a database for storage of projects instead of json file
* Make frontpage
* Make overhaul of design
* Make everything blog-related (that's not already done in old repo)
